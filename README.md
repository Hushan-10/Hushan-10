## 💼 Spotlight Projects

### 🥾 **ShoeIQ - AI-Powered Smart Shoe Rack System**  
Led a 3-member team in designing and deploying an end-to-end AI solution that intelligently recommends footwear using a custom-built ML pipeline—leveraging OpenCV for real-time outfit color analysis, weather APIs, occasion-based input, and user behavior to deliver personalized, context-aware recommendations entirely offline on a Raspberry Pi.  
- Spearheaded the development of a hybrid wetness detection system by fusing signals from a capacitive soil moisture sensor with computer vision-based wetness estimation. This custom sensing approach ensured high-accuracy detection of both internal and sole moisture levels—enhancing decision reliability.  
- Architected and implemented a LabVIEW-integrated PID control loop to dynamically modulate a Rigol Ultra Sigma power supply, adjusting fan speed in real time based on the measured wetness of the shoe. Also handled PWM-to-voltage conversion and analog signal processing for precise control of NEMA stepper motors—demonstrating advanced system integration across AI, embedded instrumentation, and control engineering.  

### 🤝 **Multi-Agent Support System with CrewAI**  
Unleashed a revolutionary multi-agent ecosystem with CrewAI, orchestrating a symphony of intelligent agents that redefine customer support. Designed a charismatic **Senior Support Representative** with ScrapWebsiteTool integration, delivering witty, context-rich responses, and a meticulous **Support Quality Assurance Specialist** to enforce flawless accuracy. This dynamic duo collaborates seamlessly, leveraging memory-driven insights and robust guardrails to transform support into an engaging, human-like experience—setting a new benchmark for AI-driven collaboration.  

### 🧾 **FLAN-T5 Dialogue Summarizer**  
Finetuned FLAN-T5 with full and LoRA-PEFT methods, achieving top-tier efficiency validated by ROUGE metrics.  

### 💬 **LLM Chatbot & Conversational RAG**  
Built a LangChain-powered GPT chatbot with multi-turn dialogue and robust context retention.  

### 🌱 **IoT-Enabled Medibox**  
Designed an ESP32-based, MQTT-optimized medication monitor with Wokwi simulation and Node-RED integration for health-critical environments.
